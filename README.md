# Welcome to the events website repository.

This repository contains a website that allows only the user part of Aston University to authenticate and get booked to an event. Only Registered Aston University members can book an event. 

#Implementations

- The backend

The backend is handled by plain php, so it takes care of the authentification and the users booking. We use mysql database to store the User's data, events' data etc... To interact with the database we used the PDO method.

- the frontend

The frontend is handled by html&css and javascript. The html code is directly writtenin the php files. All the design is added by using some css code linked to each php files.
